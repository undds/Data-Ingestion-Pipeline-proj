# Revature-Capstone
This is a project based around injesting data through CSV files and loading them into an AWS RDS PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS EC2. 

We have used the publicly available dataset "Air Quality" found at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality.
This dataset records the air quality surveillance  data in New York City.
We chose this dataset due to the up-to-date information (updated at 2/15/26 !) as well as containing a variety of different column datatypes along with a robust 18862 rows of data.
